This gets rid of the annoying "discontinued" thing on top, like i still dont care tbh, its a good theme :/

# y tho
It said i couldn't use the legendary theme starting from 3/05, which I'm assuming means May 5th (because of European/U.S. date differences). Now since I'm expecting the site where the imports were headed to go down sooner or later, I just put the code in here for a big el bruh momento. Also, it says I can't edit it because it's against the license, but if it's getting discontinued then I don't really give a crap
